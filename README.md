Undergraduate @ TMU | Coffee-fueled extrovert ☕💬

I’m a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Toronto Metropolitan University, pursuing triple minors. I’m not someone defined by a single field. While I study Computer Science with triple minors in IT, Finance, and Professional Communication, my real strength is in connecting dots across disciplines. I’ve spent over 500 hours of community service and built projects which range from company growth to personal development. I also thrived in hackathons and team challenges. What ties it all together is curiosity, the driven desire to explore opportunities, learn quickly, and turn ideas into impact. Whether it’s in technology, business, or communication, marketing, collaboration, I bring adaptability, energy, and a positive mindset.

I believe a strong team isn’t about who’s the smartest or most perfect, it’s about people who ask questions, collaborate openly, and build trust. That’s the mindset I bring: connecting with teammates not as competition, but as partners working toward something bigger.

Growing up in Toronto, I’ve learned to thrive in multicultural spaces. 🤝
